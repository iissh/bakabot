# bakabot Discord Bot
A multipurpose Discord Bot created to support gaming communities on Discord. Currently, bakabot is in multiple servers with over 2000 users. I created this project using Javascript (particularly Node.js), Discord.js, Puppeteer (web scraping), and Jimp (image manipulation).

### Prerequisites
You will need to install the following things before you can run the bot
```
Node.js
Discord.js
Puppeteer
Jimp
```
To install `Discord.js`, `Puppeteer`, and `Jimp`. You should navigate to the folder containing this bot and run the following commands.
```
npm install discord.js
npm install puppeteer
npm install jimp
```


## Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - the base that the bot runs on
* [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) - node.js link to the discord bot api
